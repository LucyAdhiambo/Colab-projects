This repository contains data analysis and visualization tools for monitoring and optimizing a boar stud of 40 animals. The goal is to track semen production, quality, sales performance, and revenue in order to improve farm management and decision-making.
 The project also includes sales analysis by region to identify market opportunities and support strategic decision-making.
